## Notes
- This dataset has high percentage of missing values, especially in the mitigation strategy columns
- Each row represents a single company (no duplicates)
- Strategy categories generally range from "No" (no strategy) to comprehensive implementation
- Visualizations comparing mitigation strategies to emission trends are available in `output/figures/png/programs1_detailed_visualization.png`

## Strategy Quality Scale
For the mitigation strategy columns, the values generally follow this quality scale:
1. "No" or "No evidence" - No implementation
2. "General statement" - Vague or limited information
3. "Some" (stores/products/facilities) - Partial implementation
4. "All" or "Aggressive efforts" - Comprehensive implementation
