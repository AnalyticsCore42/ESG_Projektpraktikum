# ESG Data Analysis: Machine Learning & Deep Learning Approaches

This document outlines six key machine learning and deep learning approaches for analyzing ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) data, focusing on emissions reduction programs and company performance.

## 1. Time Series Analysis with LSTM

**Objective**: Predict future emissions trends and identify patterns in historical emissions data.

**Approach**:
- Use PyTorch LSTM model for sequence prediction
- Analyze historical emissions data (Scope 1, 2, and 3)
- Forecast future emissions based on past trends
- Evaluate model performance using MSE and other metrics

**Key Features**:
- Bidirectional LSTM architecture
- Multiple layers for capturing complex patterns
- Dropout for regularization
- Attention mechanism for focusing on important time periods

## 2. Topic Modeling with LDA

**Objective**: Extract and understand common themes in reduction program descriptions.

**Approach**:
- Apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to program descriptions
- Identify key topics and their distributions
- Analyze topic evolution over time
- Link topics to program effectiveness

**Key Features**:
- Preprocessing with NLTK
- Topic coherence evaluation
- Visualization of topic distributions
- Temporal topic analysis

## 3. Association Rule Mining

**Objective**: Discover relationships between different reduction programs and their effectiveness.

**Approach**:
- Use Apriori algorithm to find frequent itemsets
- Generate association rules with confidence and lift metrics
- Analyze program combinations that lead to better outcomes
- Identify optimal program portfolios

**Key Features**:
- Support and confidence threshold optimization
- Rule visualization
- Program effectiveness correlation
- Portfolio optimization recommendations

## 4. Clustering Analysis

**Objective**: Group companies based on emissions profiles and program effectiveness.

**Approach**:
- Apply KMeans clustering on emissions and asset data
- Evaluate optimal number of clusters using silhouette scores
- Analyze cluster characteristics and program effectiveness
- Identify best practices within clusters

**Key Features**:
- Multi-dimensional clustering
- Cluster validation metrics
- Cluster profiling
- Best practice identification

## 5. Feature Importance Analysis

**Objective**: Identify key factors affecting emissions and program success.

**Approach**:
- Use RandomForestRegressor for feature importance
- Analyze impact of different variables on emissions
- Identify key drivers of program success
- Generate actionable insights

**Key Features**:
- Feature importance visualization
- Partial dependence plots
- Interaction effects analysis
- Actionable recommendations

## 6. BERT-based Text Analysis

**Objective**: Extract semantic meaning from program descriptions and reports.

**Approach**:
- Fine-tune BERT model on ESG-specific text
- Extract embeddings for program descriptions
- Analyze semantic similarity between programs
- Generate program effectiveness predictions

**Key Features**:
- Contextual embeddings
- Semantic similarity analysis
- Text classification
- Program effectiveness prediction

## Implementation Notes

- All analyses use PyTorch and FastAI for deep learning components
- Scikit-learn for traditional ML algorithms
- Plotly for interactive visualizations
- Proper error handling and logging throughout
- Modular design for easy extension and modification

## Next Steps

1. Implement each analysis as a separate module
