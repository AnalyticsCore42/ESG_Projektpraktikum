============= SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS =============
1. Scale of Emissions and Target-Setting:
   • Higher-emitting companies set more targets (r = 0.329, p < 0.001)
      Companies with higher absolute emissions establish more carbon reduction targets
   • Higher Scope 3 emissions correlate with more targets (r = 0.444, p < 0.001)
      Companies with extensive value chain emissions set more targets
   • Target ambition negatively related to absolute emissions (r = -0.163, p < 0.001)
      Higher-emitting companies tend to set less ambitious percentage reduction targets

2. Types of Targets and Their Effectiveness:
   • Companies using absolute targets have lower emissions intensity (rho = -0.099, p < 0.001)
      Companies choosing fixed tonnage reduction targets vs. intensity-based targets
      tend to have different emissions profiles
   • Best performing combination: Other with Production intensity approach
      Shows -11.6% emissions trend (reduction of 11.6%)
   • Worst performing combination: Energy consumption - Absolute with Production intensity approach
      Shows 3.9% emissions trend (increase of 3.9%)
   • Companies exceeding targets show best emission reductions
      Targets with 175-200% progress show -8.7% emission trend
      (reduction of 8.7%)

3. Geographic and Industry Context Matters:
   • Strong country-level relationship between targets and trends (r = -0.615, p < 0.001)
      Countries where companies set more targets show better emission reductions
   • Industry context reveals opposing patterns (range: -0.708 to 0.667)
      Some industries show positive correlations (higher emissions → more ambitious targets)
      Others show negative correlations (higher emissions → less ambitious targets)
   • Timeline vs. intensity correlation strongest at industry level (r = 0.245)
      Companies in higher-emitting industries tend to set longer-term targets
   • Target ambition vs. trend correlation strongest at country level (r = -0.239)
      National context influences the relationship between target setting and performance

4. Counterintuitive or Missing Relationships:
   • Target ambition weakly linked to emissions intensity (r = -0.128, p < 0.001)
      Higher emissions intensity doesn't drive significantly more ambitious targets
   • Timeline unrelated to emissions trend (r = -0.009, p = 0.487)
      Recent emissions performance doesn't predict target timeline
   • No systematic pattern in ambition across intensity range
      Companies at opposite ends of the intensity spectrum set similar targets
   • Weak positive link between emissions level and trend (r = 0.140, p < 0.001)
      Higher-intensity companies tend to show slightly worse emission trends
